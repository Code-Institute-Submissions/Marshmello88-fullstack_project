#The Amiibo Store Application

It's a store where a user can buy ingame items for their nintendo switch. The users only have three critical goal paths:

View the store's inventory of amiibo villagers.
Keep track of the villagers they want to purchase using favorites or using a shopping cart. 
Note: They don't need to create an account or anything to purchase an item.
Check out and pay for their items.
