Potential features to include:

    Showcase prior work for clients, based on different kinds of requests, and the customer's testimonials.

    Allow users to order a particular graphic to suit their goals. The user would fill out a form describing their needs, including fields such as type (e.g. icon, logo, poster), size and description, get an automatic quote and then pay. You may want to include a javascript calculator to display a preview of the quote, but make sure that the final price is determined on the server, and cannot be manipulated directly by the user.

    The site owner, logging in as a special user, would be able to see a list of all orders, and then upload their completed work which would be made available to the customer.

Advanced potential feature (nice-to-have)

    The customer then has the option to either accept the result, or request a round of changes.

    Once the customer accepts, they would write a testimonial and the final graphic would be automatically included in the site's showcase.

    Build a custom js display mechanism for the gallery page - e.g. your own unique kind of carousel.

Product reviews

====

A project violating any of these requirements will FAIL

    Django Full Stack Project: Build a Django project backend by a relational database to create a website that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain.

    Multiple Apps: The project must be a brand new Django project, composed of multiple apps (an app for each potentially reusable component in your project).

    Data Modeling: Put some effort into designing a relational database schema well-suited for your domain. Make sure to put some thought into the relationships between entities. Create at least 2 custom django models beyond the examples shown on the course


    User Authentication: The project should include an authentication mechanism, allowing a user to register and log in, and there should be a good reason as to why the users would need to do so. e.g., a user would have to register to persist their shopping cart between sessions (otherwise it would be lost).

    User Interaction: Include at least one form with validation that will allow users to create and edit models in the backend (in addition to the authentication mechanism).

    Use of Stripe: At least one of your Django apps should contain some e-commerce functionality using Stripe. This may be a shopping cart checkout, subscription-based payments or single payments, donations, etc. After paying successfully, the user would then gain access to additional functionality/content on the site. Note that for this project you should use Stripe's test functionality, rather than actual live payments.

    Structure and Navigation: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout (you might want to use Bootstrap to accomplish this).

    Use of JavaScript: The frontend should contain some JavaScript logic you have written to enhance the user experience.

    Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.

    Version Control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
    
    Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
    Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as Heroku.
    Security: Make sure to not include any passwords or secret keys in the project repository. Make sure to turn off the Django DEBUG mode, which could expose secrets.
